# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Adriana. Let's get to know each other :)

## Where are you from?
Well, I'm happy you asked! I was born in Puerto Rico, but I've been in the US since I was 5 years old. For the most part, I've lived in Scranton, PA.

# What are your interests? Are you boring?
Eh. I might be a little bit of a bore. I really love music. I don't think there's a single day that goes by where I don't play some tunes. Here are some of my favorite songs right now-

## I also enjoy spending time with my family and significant other. I have 3 nieces and 1 nephew :) I have three dogs. Their names are Lucy, Layla, and Lola.
